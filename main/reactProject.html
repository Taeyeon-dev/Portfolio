    <h3>What it is</h3>

    <p>Using fullcalendar that is a JavaScript library that seamlessly integrates with such popular JavaScript frameworks </p>

    <p>It is a calendar-schedular. User is available to update schedule and delete it. When finish the schedule, schedule color is changed green to red. </p>

    <br>
    <h3>What I did</h3>
    <p>
        1. Use functional components only <br>
        Only functional components were used because the functional type was simpler and there was no need for a class type when using the react hook.
        <br><br>
        2. React hook (useState(), useDispatch(), useEffect(), useRef(), useSelect())
        - When the Add button is pressed, the new schedule is saved in Firestore and redux, 
        <br>
           and it goes to the main page and dispatches the middleware function that loads the data using useEffect. 
        <br>
           Then use Select to retrieve the values stored in the redox and display them on the calendar page.
        <br>
        3. UI used css that can give elements detailed effects and styled-components for overall definition.
        <br><br>
        4. Data was given as a child component using State and Props.
        <br><br>
        5. Paging function was applied to components using Route.
        <br><br>
        (Error occurred when attempting to bind with Routes.)
        <br><br>
        6. Information was saved and retrieved using Redux.
        <br>
        -In the modal window, there are the delete schedule button and the complete button, and when you press the delete button,
        <br>
        the corresponding data in the firebase and readerx are found as id values and deleted. 
        <br>
        The complete button finds the data with the id value and updates the data key value completed to true.
        <br><br>
        7. Data can be stored using Firebase (serverless).
        <br><br>
        8. I used middleware to connect Firebase to Redux.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsive Web</h2>
    <img src="../resources/ezgif.com-gif-maker (2).gif" alt="react page">
    <p>Web pages used media queries for use on PCs, tablets, and mobile phones. <br>
        When the width became smaller at 50vw, the width changed the value from 80vw to 100vw. <br>
        And when it was too big compared to the text screen, 'display: none' was used when the screen became smaller. <br>
        When the screen becomes smaller, the modal window button is hidden in the menu icon and set to active only when clicked.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h3>What I am gonna have to do</h3>
    <p>
        1. Solve the bugs
        <br>
        (When click the add button, there is error that main page is disappeared on small size screen)
        <br>
        2. Solve the git conflict
        <br>
        Cannot commit and merge becaues of the conflict
        <br>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>What I want to do</h3>
    <p>
        1. Distingush with Full schedule and Unfinished schedule.
        <br>
        2. Create the calendar without library.
        <br>
        3. Drag and move the schedules.
